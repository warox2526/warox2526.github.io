description: For years, Lucian was a man consumed by vengeance, on the hunt for Thresh.  Over this three part story arc, we moved Lucian from grief, to acceptance, to disbelief and finally brought him back to love or rather brought his love back to him.  Lucian had accomplished his mission, but Senna’s was just getting started.

<h6 class="post-subtitle">Project Details</h6>

The Senna story was an opportunity to move one of our most well established character arcs forward with the release of Lucian’s wife, Senna. This was a larger more story focused campaign than we would typically do for a single champion release, but it was something I pushed for as I knew the return of Lucian's wife was an important moment for players to experience alongside Lucian. I was creative director for the overall story campaign and co-wrote/director for the animated portions.
