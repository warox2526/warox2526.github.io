description: The Boogie Man of Bilgewater.  Pyke is driven by vengeance, but his madness is what makes him so scary.  He is a great character in his own right, but at the same time he makes the world of Bilgewater feel full and thus real.  He evokes imagery of fearful sailors telling ghost stories to their shipmates.  Never turn your back on the sea.
