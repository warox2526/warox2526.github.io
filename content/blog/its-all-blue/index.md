description: For years, Lucian was a man consumed by vengeance, on the hunt for Thresh.  Over this three part story arc, we moved Lucian from grief, to acceptance, to disbelief and finally brought him back to love or rather brought his love back to him.  Lucian had accomplished his mission, but Senna’s was just getting started.

The Senna story was an opportunity to move one of our most well established character arcs forward with the release of Lucian’s wife Senna.  This was a larger more story focused campaign than we would typically do for a single champion release, but it was something I fought for as I knew this was an important moment for players to experience the return of Lucian’s wife alongside him.  I was creative director for the overall story campaign and co-wrote/director the animated portions.
