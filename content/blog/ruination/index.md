description: On some level, Senna had always known the threat that the power inside her posed to the world.  That very power is what she would use to save the world or so she thought.  When Senna goes to meet her destiny she throws caution, and the protests of her love, to the wind.  She meets a foe she is not prepared for, the source of the black mist coursing through her body.  The results of the conflict ripple throughout the world and give the champions of Runeterra a taste of the devastation that Senna had hoped to stop.

<h6 class="post-subtitle">Project Details</h6>
Shadowâ€™s Embrace purposefully left a lot of questions for players about the future for Senna and Lucian after being reunited.  The popularity of their story gave us an opportunity to revisit it and show how the consequences of their story would affect the stories of other champions throughout the world.  We did that in Ruination to kick off the 2021 Season of LoL and set up future storytelling throughout the year.
